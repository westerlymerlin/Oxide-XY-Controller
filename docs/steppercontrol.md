# steppercontrol

Stepper motor control interface for Raspberry Pi hardware control system.

This module provides functionality to control and monitor stepper motors connected
to the Raspberry Pi. It handles both status reporting and command parsing for
motor control operations.

Functions:
    statusmessage() -> dict:
        Returns the current status of all stepper motors in the system.
        The status includes position, state, and other relevant motor parameters.
        Returns:
            dict: Current status of the stepper motors

    parsecontrol(item: str, command: str) -> dict:
        Parses and executes control commands for specified stepper motor.

        Args:
            item (str): The identifier of the stepper motor to control
            command (str): The control command to execute

        Returns:
            dict: Result of the control operation including status and any error messages

Note:
    This module interfaces directly with hardware components and should be used
    with appropriate driver board to prevent mechanical issues.

## StepperClass Objects

```python
class StepperClass()
```

Class to manage and control a stepper motor using GPIO and threading.

This class provides methods to move, stop, calibrate, and manage the position
of a stepper motor. It uses GPIO pins for hardware interaction and threading
for continuous monitoring of limit switches and movement control. The class
ensures safe operation by respecting hardware-defined movement limits and includes
calibration capabilities to define the valid range of motion. The settings
configuration is used for storing and updating operational parameters.

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.__init__"></a>

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(direction, a, aa, b, bb, limmax, limmin, moveled)
```

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.__read_switches"></a>

#### \_\_read\_switches

```python
def __read_switches()
```

Continuously monitors the state of the minimum and maximum limit switches and updates
the corresponding attributes. Reacts to changes in the limit switch states by logging
events and optionally stopping movement. Also manages the LED indicating movement
activity.

:raises RuntimeError: If the GPIO library encounters an error while reading input values
    or controlling PWM components.

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.current"></a>

#### current

```python
def current()
```

Return current sequence, only used for debugging

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.movenext"></a>

#### movenext

```python
def movenext()
```

Move +1 step towards the maximum, if the maximum value has been reached it will not move further

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.moveprevious"></a>

#### moveprevious

```python
def moveprevious()
```

Move -1 step towards the minimum, if the minimum value has been reached it will not move further.

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.updateposition"></a>

#### updateposition

```python
def updateposition()
```

write the stepper position to the settings file

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.stop"></a>

#### stop

```python
def stop()
```

Stop the stepper motor and set the coils to 0, also update the position of the stepper and write to
the settings file

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.move"></a>

#### move

```python
def move(steps)
```

Move **n steps** at full speed

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.moveslow"></a>

#### moveslow

```python
def moveslow(steps)
```

Move **steps** slowly

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.moveto"></a>

#### moveto

```python
def moveto(target)
```

Moves the axis to the specified target position within its limits.

This method initiates the movement process for the axis motor to reach the
desired target position. The movement continues as long as the motor is in
motion and has not been interrupted by external control. The method checks
if the target position is within the specified range of lower and upper limits
and adjusts the motor position incrementally. It stops the motion and updates
the motor status accordingly when the target is reached or the sequence changes.

:param target: Desired position to move the axis to.
:type target: int or float
:return: None

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.output"></a>

#### output

```python
def output(channels)
```

Output the value to the coils on the stepper

<a id="steppercontrol.StepperClass.calibrate"></a>

#### calibrate

```python
def calibrate()
```

Run a calibration routine to find the man and max limit switches and reset the position of the stage. The
routine will move the stepper backward as far as the minimum switch is triggered, it will then slowly move the
stepper forward until the switch is just released. This position is then recorded as zero. The stepper will
then be moved forward unti the maximum limit is triggeed, then move backward until the switch is released,
this position (- 10 steps) is stored as the maximum value. The routine then calculates the centre position and
moves the stepper to that position. When calibrating the read() method will not stop the motor when a limit
switch is triggered

<a id="steppercontrol.statusmessage"></a>

#### statusmessage

```python
def statusmessage()
```

Return the psotion and stepper status in a format that can be read by the web page

<a id="steppercontrol.apistatus"></a>

#### apistatus

```python
def apistatus()
```

Return the status as a json message for the api

<a id="steppercontrol.updatesetting"></a>

#### updatesetting

```python
def updatesetting(newsetting)
```

Update the settings variable and file with the new values from an api call

<a id="steppercontrol.parsecontrol"></a>

#### parsecontrol

```python
def parsecontrol(item, command)
```

Parser that recieves messages from the API or web page posts and directs messages to the correct function:
Valid messages are:
getxystatus: returns the current position of the steppers
(axis)move: moves the stepper axis by the number of steps specified
(axix)moveto: moves the stepper axis to the position specified
(axis)calibrate: calibrates the stepper axis
calibrate-all: calibrates both axes
output: sets the coils on the stepper to the value specified (used foir testing ta stepper motor
getsettings: returns the current settings in a json format
updatesetting: updates the settings file with the new values specified in a json object
restart: restarts the raspberry pi
